## Article Insights Pipeline

> Automated NLP pipeline powered by Apache Airflow 3 — extracts keywords, sentiment, named entities, readability scores, and social snippets from Medium articles. Built with NLTK and TextBlob.

---

## Overview

**Article Insights Pipeline** is a local NLP pipeline that takes a Medium article as input and automatically runs a suite of text analysis tasks in parallel using Apache Airflow 3. Results are saved as a structured JSON file for downstream use in content strategy, SEO, and social media.

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/article-insights-pipeline.git
cd article-insights-pipeline
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv airflow-env
source airflow-env/bin/activate
```

### 3. Set environment variables

```bash
export AIRFLOW_HOME=$(pwd)
export AIRFLOW__CORE__XCOM_BACKEND=airflow.models.xcom.BaseXCom
```

Add these to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` to persist them:

```bash
echo 'export AIRFLOW_HOME=/path/to/project' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export AIRFLOW__CORE__XCOM_BACKEND=airflow.models.xcom.BaseXCom' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### 4. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install "apache-airflow>=3.0.0"
pip install nltk textblob
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### 5. Initialize the database

```bash
airflow db migrate
```
### 6. Run Airflow locally
```
airflow standalone
```

##  DAG Architecture

The pipeline loads the article first, then runs all NLP tasks in **parallel**, and finally aggregates results:

```
load_article
     │
     ├──> extract_keywords
     ├──> summarize_article
     ├──> analyze_sentiment   ──> save_results
     ├──> extract_entities
     ├──> compute_readability
     └──> generate_snippets
```

## 📦 Dependencies

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `apache-airflow>=3.0.0` | Pipeline orchestration |
| `nltk` | Tokenization, NER, keyword extraction |
| `textblob` | Sentiment analysis |
