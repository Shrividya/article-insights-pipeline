  "summary": "There was one answer that I appreciated \u2014 even while not trying to be biased or judgmental \u2014 and it goes:\n\n\u201cI do express to know if I\u2019m fooling myself or if the other person feels something too.\u201d\n\nTrust me, this can save young girls and emotionally invested women from a lot of sadness that could come from heartbreaks or one-sided love. One respondent put it powerfully:\n\n\u201cLove can be unconditional, but relationships are a bit conditional \u2014 they\u2019re about walking together, adjusting, surviving.\u201d\n\nLove was also described as comfort, companionship, and emotional safety. Some women are noticeably head over heels, as their response said:\n\n\u201cI might have had high standards set for my partner, but you make it look like it\u2019s the bare minimum.\u201d\n\nOthers said:\n\n\u201cI love you more than I could ever try and express.\u201d. Emotional intimacy is a key foundation of a healthy relationship \u2014 it builds trust, provides emotional security, relieves stress, and can ultimately make or break the relationship, forming the base of love itself. Many women admitted that their first assumption was blunt:\n\n\u201cMen care about looks \u2014 often prioritizing physical appearance, social presentation, or how well a woman fits into their family dynamic.\u201d\n\nHowever, over time, some respondents shared that their perception has shifted.",

    "While they agreed that as young girls they might have been influenced by movies and expected that kind of cinematic experience, when they actually started experiencing love or felt the emotion, it was not the Bollywood gimmicks they fell for, but rather for the: Openness in communication, Understanding, Appreciation, Friendship that didn\u2019t judge them.",
