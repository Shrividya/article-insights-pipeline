Emotions are the most powerful aspect of being human. The beauty lies in how differently each of us feels them. Every joy, ache, fear, and longing registers on a unique scale, forming the perfect recipe for our personality.

When people co-exist, it’s only natural to try and decode each other’s emotions. We’re always tuning ourselves — consciously or not — to match the emotional wavelength of the people we care about. Unless, of course, you’re one of the lucky few who stumble upon a tailor-made soulmate, someone already fluent in your emotional language.

That’s rare!

What I’ve noticed, especially in relationships, is that many men seem to be trying — or sometimes struggling — to understand the emotional nuances of women. And it’s not always a matter of effort, but clarity.

So, I decided to bridge that gap in a small but meaningful way. I created a short survey — asking a few questions that men often wish they could ask, and women might be eager to answer.

The responses I received from women — irrespective of age, marital status, or cultural background — were beautiful, honest, layered, and unexpectedly moving. In this article, I share each question, summarize what women shared, and offer a window into how love and relationships look through their eyes.

Have you ever been in love?
No matter how diverse the group of women I sent this survey to — different ages, backgrounds, beliefs — the response to this question was unanimous.

Every single one said yes.

That might not sound surprising at first, but think about it: in a world where love is constantly questioned, complicated, or withheld, not one woman hesitated to say she had experienced it.

Do you express love easily? Why or why not?
(As in, if you have feelings for someone, how easily do you tell them about it?)

The responses to this question made me go “aww…”. There were a couple of “yes”, “quite easily” — and I was super happy that women are not waiting to be proposed to, but rather won’t mind expressing it openly.

Around 20% of the women said they would take some time to know if they are actually serious about what they are feeling, and then might as well say it out loud once they are comfortable or feel safe sharing how they feel.

70% of the answers were inclined to expressing love in the form of gestures or actions rather than words.

There was one answer that I appreciated — even while not trying to be biased or judgmental — and it goes:

“I do express to know if I’m fooling myself or if the other person feels something too.”

Trust me, this can save young girls and emotionally invested women from a lot of sadness that could come from heartbreaks or one-sided love.

What’s love in your opinion? And how has that shaped the way you show or expect love?
For most of the women who responded, love isn’t just a feeling — it’s a quiet, consistent presence. It’s showing up, growing together, and being deeply tuned in to the small, often unspoken ways people give and receive care.

Many defined love as unconditional, in contrast to relationships, which were seen as more conditional — shaped by expectations, compromises, and real-world responsibilities. One respondent put it powerfully:

“Love can be unconditional, but relationships are a bit conditional — they’re about walking together, adjusting, surviving.”

Love was also described as comfort, companionship, and emotional safety. It’s being completely at ease with someone — even in silence.

When it came to how love is shown, themes of patience, presence, admiration, and everyday support came through clearly. Whether it’s thoughtful gifts, making someone laugh, cheering them on, or simply offering comfort food during tough times, love was seen in the little things done consistently — not grand gestures.

For some, love had reshaped who they are. One woman shared that being loved deeply by her partner helped her grow in ways she hadn’t expected — emotionally, mentally, and personally.

Overall, the women described love as an evolving rhythm — a space where both people are allowed to become more of themselves.

What’s one thing you learned from a past relationship (or crush) that changed how you view love?
The most common takeaway shared by women was this: not everyone who claims to love you truly does. Some respondents expressed how difficult it can be to tell who’s genuine — especially when words and actions don’t always align. For some, past experiences taught them that certain men enter relationships to “win” rather than to build something real — whether it’s about ego, avoiding loneliness, or simply playing a role.

One woman said:

“Not every man who expresses love actually feels it. Some just want the idea of a woman, not the reality of her.”

Others learned to take their time, to observe more deeply, and not to be misled by appearances. Emotional immaturity, masked by charm or surface-level stability, was a recurring theme.

A few respondents reflected more inwardly — realizing that happiness has to come from within, and that intentionality and transparency are essential ingredients in love.

Even those who hadn’t been in a relationship yet shared meaningful thoughts. One woman noted how powerful it is to carry the best qualities of people we’ve loved forward, saying that love can shape us — even when it doesn’t last.

And for one respondent, meeting her soulmate changed everything — revealing a “different world” where love felt effortless, deep, and safe.

What does emotional intimacy mean to you? And how important is it in a relationship?
To all the folks taking notes, let me tell you — emotional intimacy is the core aspect of your relationship with any woman.

Honestly, I’ve never met a single woman who says she is troubled by someone who is emotionally present for her. 😄

All the women collectively agreed that a relationship is meaningless if the partner is not emotionally available — no matter how bright your diamonds shine.

50% of responses said they valued the environment their partner had set for them by being a great listener. Every woman almost replied the same set of sentences for this question, saying:

“Emotional intimacy means open and honest communication, truly listening, and being mentally present for each other. It is about sharing thoughts, fears, pain, and happiness without fear of judgment, feeling safe to be vulnerable, and feeling emotionally connected.”

Mental and emotional presence matters more than physical presence, and a strong emotional bond can sustain even long-distance relationships. Emotional intimacy is a key foundation of a healthy relationship — it builds trust, provides emotional security, relieves stress, and can ultimately make or break the relationship, forming the base of love itself.

What kind of love do you desire today — and has that changed over time?
This might surprise a lot of men, but long story short — women don’t believe in Bollywood movie-style love/romance anymore.

While they agreed that as young girls they might have been influenced by movies and expected that kind of cinematic experience, when they actually started experiencing love or felt the emotion, it was not the Bollywood gimmicks they fell for, but rather for the:

Openness in communication
Understanding
Appreciation
Friendship that didn’t judge them
Women cutely set the bare minimum to things like:

Having a nice bowl of Maggi together
Watching a movie together after a hectic day of work
Even small, noticeable attempts by their partner to spend some quality time with them and talk about how their day went
All the responses were singing a chorus of the same ask:

Being able to completely trust someone and spend some quality time with them.

Do you feel women are romanticized or misunderstood in love? Why or why not?
While most of the women agreed that they were conveniently idealized when they suffered, endured, and tolerated anything that kept peace…Some women said that they were misunderstood initially due to miscommunication, but eventually, their partners understood them much better.
It kinda broke my heart here when some admitted 😢: — “Unrealistic surrender is expected from women even when they get trash talked and treated badly. When they take a stand for themselves because no one else does, they get labelled as rebels.”

My personal advice:
You can ensure that the person you love doesn’t have to go through such an experience. 🤷‍♀️

What do you think most men misunderstand about women when it comes to love or dating?
Women said, in their opinion, men think women need grand gestures or are materialistic. This was literally what every woman unanimously voiced.

They also clarified that everyone loves surprises once in a while — but that’s not what love is all about. They valued surprises only when men actually meant it, and not like a checklist they need to tick to win over women.

One interesting response said:“Men think ‘no’ means try harder. They need to understand that women are not challenging them when they are admitting that they are not interested in the relationship moving forward.”

What advice would you give your younger self (or another girl) about love and relationships?
The advice was exactly like an elder sister’s voice: — “I would suggest, don’t forget about yourself while in love. Meet friends, have fun, and be yourself. You need to say ‘No’ when you are not okay with something. Spend enough time before getting committed.”

Common advice:
“Choosing a life partner is an important aspect of life. Choose them wisely.”

10% of the advice suggested having patience and not rushing into relationships due to pressure — be it peer pressure or pressure from family.

What does emotional maturity in a man look like, in your opinion?
Emotional maturity, according to most responses, is about self-awareness, emotional responsibility, and respect.

It’s the ability to pause and respond calmly, without ego or overreaction. Women valued men who take ownership in a relationship — making decisions independently, balancing loyalty between partner and family, and not involving others in private matters.

Key traits included:

Emotional availability
Active listening
Fairness
Willingness to grow
As one woman put it:

“Nobody is 100% mature — but it shows in how they support you through everything, with consistency and grace.”

What do you believe men look for in a woman? Has that thought changed over time or have you been proved right about it?
Many women admitted that their first assumption was blunt:

“Men care about looks — often prioritizing physical appearance, social presentation, or how well a woman fits into their family dynamic.”

However, over time, some respondents shared that their perception has shifted. While surface-level attraction still plays a role, they’ve seen more men value:

Emotional support
Understanding
Good communication
Shared values
One woman put it simply:

“Earlier, it was about needing a lady in the house. Now, it’s about finding a life partner.”

Others noted that expectations vary widely — there’s no single answer, and men, like women, aren’t a monolith. Still, the blend of realism and evolving hope was a consistent thread.

If you could say one thing to the kind of man you hope to love (or already love), what would it be?
Women are certainly sweet — especially towards their partners. 😉 While a few responses also asked their partners to have open communication and feel free to express emotions.
Many responses echoed:

“We are in this together ❤️”

Some women are noticeably head over heels, as their response said:

“I might have had high standards set for my partner, but you make it look like it’s the bare minimum.”

Others said:

“I love you more than I could ever try and express.”

That’s all I had asked my beautiful women — and aren’t they sweet?! 🥹
I know this turned into a fairly long article, but since we’re talking about bridging gaps and offering clarity, I hope the length isn’t an issue.
